# Odense Pride
It is time for Odense's first Pride. Help us make Odense more Queer, and fight for love and tolerance, when we walk from Flakhaven (Town hall square) along a route towards Kongens Have, where there will be booths, artists and music.

We will keep an eye on the corona situation to ensure there are nescessary safety precautions, but be sure to find your prettiest face mask!

This event will be updated with more information about artists, route, cooperative partners and more, but save the date in your calendar! We are a new initiative, and are still developing and planning the Pride, do you want to join us? Then write to odensepride@gmail.com and hear more about how you can help. We are looking for volunteers, sponsors, cooperatative partners who what to hold events and more.
